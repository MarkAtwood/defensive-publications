# Defensive Publications

This repository exists to publish prior art and prevent the issuance of obvious or derivative patents.  
Every document in this repository is a **defensive publication** — a public disclosure that places an idea, method, or design into the public domain, making it unpatentable by others.

## Purpose

The global patent system rewards novelty, not merit.  
By publishing these documents, we create verifiable prior art to block bad patents and keep fundamental techniques, protocols, and designs freely usable by everyone.

Defensive publication is the simplest and most durable form of patent defense.  
Once something is publicly disclosed, it becomes part of the permanent record and can be cited as prior art by examiners worldwide.
